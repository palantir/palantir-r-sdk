    Migrating the SDK to use the Foundry API.

    Improvements:
    * Removed the dependency on `reticulate`
    * Added the ability to import a subset of rows or columns in `read_table`
    * Added support for configuration through `options`

    Breaking changes:
    * All endpoints now require an alias configured in `~/.foundry/aliases.yml`, RIDs and Compass paths are not allowed anymore
    * Renamed the functions to names consistent with other SDKs
